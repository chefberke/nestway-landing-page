# Nestway Home Landing Page

Hello everyone, thank you for viewing the project. I would be very happy if you could leave a star rating.

I found this project in the Figma community section and I wanted to recreate it using HTML and CSS, that's all. I'm still working on making it responsive. You can check out the new commits. I hope it helps everyone.
